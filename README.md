# Grid-Path-Generator

The Project Aim is to Generate a valid Path for a Given start and End Point in a Grid(of size m X n).

Click here to view the Application :->   https://coolujjwal.github.io/Grid-Path-Generator/

The Following Algorithms have been Implemented so far
      
       1. BFS ( Breadth first Search)
       2. Dijkstra (Shortest Path between two points)

In this Application,

       1. User can change the Start and End point if required ( By default Start point is at top-left corner and End point is at bottom-right corner).
       2. User can insert Wall or Obstacles any number of times Similarly He can remove it also.
       3. User can change the size of Grid (By default it is 42 X 60). The maximum size is also 42 X 60.
       4. If there is no Path Exist for a Grid then an Alert box will Pop-up.
       5. In the Algorithm which is Implemented, Only Left, Right, Up and Down moves have been considered.
